            Hello, my name is Aaron. I am  majoring in Information Technology with a focus in cyber security. I have lived in Georgia the majority of my Life with a brief period spent in Alabama attending Auburn University. I am still undecided on what I aim to do with my degree and what direction I want my professional career to go. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My hobbies include running, video games, and anime. I will admit I havenâ€™t been nearly as active as I would like to be in the past few years. I play Overwatch 2 on a regular basis. I am also finishing the dead space remake at the moment.
        </p>
